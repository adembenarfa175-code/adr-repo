# Arch Developers Repositories (ADR) - Recommended yay Configuration Notes
#
# This file serves as documentation for users integrating ADR with yay.
# There is no default yay.conf file; yay uses pacman.conf and shell settings.
#
# --- 1. Pacman Configuration ---
# Ensure [adr-stable] is defined in /etc/pacman.conf above any other extra repos.
# ADR's stability relies on overriding less-tested packages from other sources.

[adr-stable]
SigLevel = Optional TrustAll
Server = https://adembenarfa175-code.github.io/adr-repo/repo/$arch

# --- 2. Recommended yay Flags ---
# These are the recommended yay settings for maximum stability with ADR:
#
# A. Prefer binaries (Skip reviewing PKGBUILDs unless strictly necessary)
# yay --noconfirm --binupgrade
#
# B. Do not clean up build directories unnecessarily (Faster rebuilds)
# yay --save --noclean
#
# C. Ensure yay treats ADR as a primary stable source
# (No specific flag needed, as ADR is added directly to pacman.conf)
#
# --- 3. ADR-Specific AUR Override List ---
# If ADR builds any packages that conflict with common AUR packages, 
# those packages should be explicitly ignored from AUR by the user:
#
# Example (if ADR provides 'app-x' and AUR has 'app-x-git'):
# To skip AUR packages, users should use the '--ignore' flag in yay/pacman.
# Example: yay -Syu --ignore app-x-git
