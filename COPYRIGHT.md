## 2. Licensing (GPLv2)

This original work, including the custom tools used for repository management, is licensed under the terms of the **GNU General Public License, Version 2 (GPLv2)**.

### The Significance of GPLv2:

GPLv2 is a **Strong Copyleft** license, which guarantees four essential user freedoms, ensuring that any derivative work maintains the same level of freedom:

1.  **Freedom to Use:** You are free to run the program for any purpose.
2.  **Freedom to Study and Modify:** You can study how the program works and adapt it to your needs (requires access to the Source Code).
3.  **Freedom to Share:** You are free to redistribute copies of the program.
4.  **Freedom to Distribute Modified Versions:** You are free to distribute copies of your modified versions under the same GPLv2 terms.

**The Strictness:** If you distribute a derivative work based on this project's GPLv2 code, you are legally obligated to license your entire resulting work under GPLv2 terms. This is the mechanism that protects the freedom of the code.

**For the full text of the license, please see the accompanying [LICENSE](LICENSE) file in this repository or visit [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/).**

## 3. Third-Party Packages

The binary package files compiled and provided in this repository source their code from original projects (primarily the official Arch Linux repositories). As such:

* Each binary package retains the license specified by its original upstream author.
* The vast majority of core Linux system packages are licensed under the GPL, ensuring full compatibility with the GPLv2 licensing of our build tools.
