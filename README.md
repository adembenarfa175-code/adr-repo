# ðŸš€ Arch Developers Repositories (ADR)

## Stable, Curated Arch Packages for Developers and Power Users

The **Arch Developers Repositories (ADR)** project provides a set of highly stable, carefully curated packages for Arch Linux. We aim to offer the rolling-release benefits of Arch while mitigating the risk of instability often encountered by developers and system administrators.

ADR acts as a **"Delayed Rolling Release"** repositoryâ€”packages are synchronized from the official Arch repos, subjected to stability checks and necessary patching, and then released in controlled cycles.
